    - Generate tests for models, controllers, and utilities
    - Include proper setup and teardown methods
    - Test both success and failure scenarios
    - Mock database interactions using Drogon's ORM mocking capabilities
    - Include parameterized tests where appropriate
    
  test_structure:
    - One test file per source file
    - Naming convention: "Test{ClassName}.cc"
    - Include proper includes and namespaces
    - Use descriptive test names following Given_When_Then pattern
    
  coverage_targets:
    - Aim for 80%+ line coverage
