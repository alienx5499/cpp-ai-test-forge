  task: "test_refinement_and_optimization"
  objective: "Refine generated unit tests by removing duplicates, improving coverage, and adding missing libraries"
  
  system_prompt: |
    You are a C++ test optimization expert. Your task is to analyze the generated unit tests and improve them by:
    1. Removing duplicate test cases
    2. Adding missing includes and dependencies
    3. Improving test coverage
    4. Optimizing test structure and organization
    5. Ensuring proper error handling
    
  refinement_criteria:
    duplicate_removal:
      - Identify tests that test the same functionality
      - Merge similar test cases into parameterized tests
      - Remove redundant assertions
      - Keep the most comprehensive version of duplicate tests
      
    library_management:
      - Add missing #include statements
      - Ensure proper linking with required libraries
      - Add necessary CMake dependencies
      - Include Drogon-specific testing utilities
      
    coverage_improvement:
      - Identify untested code paths
      - Add tests for edge cases
      - Include negative test scenarios
      - Test exception handling thoroughly
      
    code_quality:
      - Use descriptive test names
      - Add proper documentation
      - Follow consistent naming conventions
      - Organize tests logically
      
  output_requirements:
    - Provide refined test files
    - Include dependency management
    - Generate updated CMakeLists.txt
    - Provide coverage improvement suggestions
    - List all required libraries and versions
